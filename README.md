# Carryover_Imputation

A set of R scripts that simulates within-person longitudinal data, removes X%
cases at random (MAR), and then applies various missing data remediation
procedures, including carryover imputation (i.e., last observation carried
forward), and multiple imputations via the `PAN` algorithm.

Useful for testing the viability of different means of remediating missing data
in complex (i.e., within-person, longitudinal) data.
